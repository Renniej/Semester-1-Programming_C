For(Initlization; condition; i++/counter condition)
Do ... while(condition)
while ( condition)



Do ... while does the code once then decides whether or not to initalize the loop.
While looks at the condition then goes through the code & loop if the condition is met. 

a conditional expression is a expression in code that must be met in order for something to happen.
Ex. If (a > b) { printf("A is bigger then B");}     
In this case a > b is the conditional expression and if it is not met then the following code does not
execute.
