1- What do think is the most important thing you learned in this workshop?

The most important thing I learnt in this understanding the importantance of paying attention 
to what type of variables you are working with. I can see how not properly type casting/mixing variable types
such as float & double could lead to some huge development walls, especially if your not continously testing
your program. 
2- Why must you add .005 to the value derived when calculating the GST owing?
It was used to make sure that GST would be properly calculated and rounded. 

3- What is the result of a casting operation?

Casting changes one variable type to another.

4- Why do you think you were required to use the modulus operator in this workshop?

I believe modulus was required so that we could learn and understand of how int and double variables behave when and
when not typecasted. Without the required modulus operator this excerise would of been just a easy extension to
the in_lab portion.  While adding modulus brings up an extra unecessary barrier it also offers
 essential knowledge variable behaviour.
