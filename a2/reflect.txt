The naming schemes for both findContactIndex & getTenDigitPhone are so straightfoward that
even if someone wasn't a coder they could get the jest of what it does. 

GetTenDigitPhone ensures
that the program will never crash if the user enters a number larger than 11 nor will it accept 
any number less than that. It is also very easy to edit in the future if a programmer wanted it
to take less or more digits. 


Since we don't have to rewrite the code found in findContactIndex over and over again.  When bug testing
we can assume that findContactIndex is working properly & spend more time looking at other possible places for bugs.


4. 

- New Librays and functions such as isDigit(), isSpace()
- Int does not support 11 digit number(float or double is better)
- Relearnt how to bubble sort
- fget, clearing \n out of char arrays that got input from Fget.
- Accounting for more invalid inputs
