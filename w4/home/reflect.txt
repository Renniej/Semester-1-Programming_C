1) The max number of days was 10 so you had to make sure you had enough space to hold a max of 10 elements.
2) Matching arrays help keep your data organize and readable to others.  The disadvtange of them is now you have to account for 2 sets of arrays instead of 1.
3) I found the at home portion a bit difficult due to me not using a flowchart/plan it before hand.  I kind of coded line by line  as I read the instructions. 
Because of this my code quickly became messy due to mistakes and what not.  

If i were to try this again i would 
1. make a flowchart 
2. Incorporate some functions to make it more readable/organized.
